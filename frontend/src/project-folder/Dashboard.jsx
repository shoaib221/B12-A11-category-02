// What is the Project? "ScholarStream" is a full-stack MERN application designed to 
// connect students with scholarship opportunities. It allows universities or organizations 
// to post scholarships and students to search and apply for them. 
// Why should we develop the project?  To simplify the complex process of finding 
// f
// inancial aid for education. A centralized platform helps students discover 
// opportunities they might miss and streamlines the application review process for 
// administrators. 
// How the system works: 
// 1. Students browse scholarships, view details, and apply by paying an application 
// fee. 
// 2. Moderators review these applications, provide feedback, and update the 
// application status (Pending -> Processing -> Completed). 
// 3. Admins Manage users, add/edit scholarships, and view analytics.
